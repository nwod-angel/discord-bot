        "If your character attacks from the side or rear of an unsuspecting target, a reflexive Wits + Composure roll is allowed for the target to recognize the imminent attack (see 'Surprise,' p. 151). If the roll fails, the victim doesn't respond and his Defense is not applied to the attack. If your character intends to use a ranged attack against the target, the reflexive Wits + Composure roll is still allowed at the Storyteller's discretion. Perhaps the target could see the sniper out of the corner of his eye or in a reflection. If the intended target's Wits + Composure roll succeeds, Initiative is rolled between combatants, and Defense applies against close-combat attacks.",
        "If your character attacks from the side or rear of an opponent in an established fight (Initiative has been rolled all around), the attacker's angle or vantage point offers no bonus. The combatants are aware of each other and/or on their guard from all angles."
