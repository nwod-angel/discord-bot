If a mage has seen or studied a resonance before and is familiar with it, one success allows him to recognize the subject. He can recognize the resonance of the subject regardless of any sort of physical disguise or transformation, allowing him to detect people in disguise or under the effects of a transformative spell. With five successes, he can recognize shapeshifters in any of their forms. There are some means of disguising a subject's resonance (see below). Note that powerful mages have strong auras. Their Gnosis gives others a bonus to notice and scrutinize their resonance. See 'Gnosis,' pp. 75-76." },
        { prefix: "Nature: (1 success)", text: "Resonance reveals a subject's true nature: human or inhuman, mortal or spirit, Sleeper or Awakened. One success is enough to alert the mage that the person is not what he seems to be, but the mage doesn't necessarily know what the subject really is. Five successes allow a mage to determine a subject's true nature. Among other things, this insight allows the Awakened to recognize each other through resonance, unless concealed in some way. Mages can also pick supernatural beings such as vampires or shapeshifters out of a group of ordinary mortals, although they might not be able to identify what they are, only that they aren't normal." },
