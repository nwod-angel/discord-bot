        { prefix: "Suspicion (mild)", text: "The mage is extremely suspicious of everyone’s motives toward him — everyone is a suspect plotting to do him wrong. The mage questions everyone’s sincerity and doubts that anyone tries to help him, even if someone saves his life. He suffers a –1 penalty on all Social rolls. Note that, even though he is suspicious, he can still be taken in by con men and hucksters. He gets no special bonus to resist their attempts to sway him even though he suspects them of being as bad as everyone else. Ironically, the character’s suspicions only make him more susceptible than usual to Mind magic, as he expects to be taken advantage of. He suffers a –1 dice penalty when contesting or countering such spells. He suffers –1 dot to his Resistance Attribute when resisting Mind magic (see the spell description for the specific Attribute used)." },
        { prefix: "Paranoia (severe)", text: "The mage believes that her misery and insecurity stem from external persecution and hostility. Paranoids obsess over their persecution complexes, often creating vast and intricate conspiracy theories to explain who torments them and why. Anyone or anything perceived to be “one of them” might be subjected to violence. The mage suffers a –2 penalty on Social rolls. She is distrustful and wary of everyone, even close friends and family. The slightest hint of suspicious behavior is enough to provoke the mage to flee or attack an offender. Her paranoia practically guarantees that her worst fears about others come true. She suffers a –2 dice penalty when contesting or countering Mind spells. She suffers –2 dots to her Resistance Attribute when resisting Mind magic (see the spell description for the specific Attribute used)." },
