        { prefix: "Irrationality (mild)", text: "The mage feels threatened and reacts without logic or reason. Her only way to comfortably deal with confrontation is to act crazy or over the top, in wild hopes that she will scare away her oppressor or at least mitigate her own fears. This behavior persists for the remainder of the Bedlam’s duration. Ironically, she takes dangerous risks that might harm her worse than the actual threat posed. If a bouncer demands to know what she is doing in an off-limits part of a club, she might overreact and get in his face. The truly ironic part about this behavior is that during such a bout, the mage cannot initiate violence, only respond to it if it occurs. She can threaten or cajole challengers, but can’t take the first swing. (That, in fact, is what her crazed behavior tries to avoid.) In addition, her illogical mindset makes her covert spells Improbable to Sleeper witnesses." },
        { prefix: "Multiple Personality (severe; extreme)", text: "The mage’s personality is fractured into one or more additional personas, allowing her to deny her trauma or any actions the trauma causes by placing the blame on 'someone else.' Each personality is created to respond to certain emotional stimuli. An abused person might develop a tough-as-nails survivor personality, create a 'protector,' or even become a murderer to deny the abuse she suffers. In most cases, none of these personalities is aware of the others, and they come and go through the mage’s mind in response to specific situations or conditions. The mage can manifest different Skills or perhaps increased or diminished Social Attributes for each identity (the number of dots allocated to the character’s Social Attributes are rearranged by anywhere from one to three). In addition, her illogical mindset makes her covert spells Improbable to Sleeper witnesses." },
