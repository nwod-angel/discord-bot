        { prefix: "Inferiority Complex (mild)", text: "The mage is overcome with self-doubt. The weight of momentous choice is too much for her and she is flustered, doubting her ability to choose correctly or to perform adequately. Any rolls made for the remainder of the scene suffer a –1 penalty. In addition, a Willpower point cannot be spent on any roll (although it can be spent to boost Defense). The mage’s fixation on her ability to make decisions makes her especially susceptible to Fate magic; she suffers a –1 dice penalty when contesting or countering such spells. She suffers –1 dot to her Resistance Attribute when resisting Fate magic (see the spell description for the specific Attribute used)." },

She suffers a –2 dice penalty when contesting or countering Fate spells, and –2 dots to her Resistance Attribute when resisting Fate magic (see the spell description for the specific Attribute used)." },
