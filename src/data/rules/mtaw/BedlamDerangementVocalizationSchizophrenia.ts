            prefix: "Vocalization (mild)", text: "Whenever the mage must make a decision about a course of action or is under extreme stress, he talks to himself without realizing it. He vocalizes his internal monologue, but realizes it only if it’s pointed out by others, at which point he can stop for one turn per dot of Wits that he has. After that period, he forgets himself and starts doing it all over again. This behavior persists for the remainder of the Bedlam’s duration. He vocalizes even if opponents or rivals can hear. It’s hard to keep his thoughts and feelings secret when he speaks them aloud."
        },
        "For example, a rival might demand that he reveal the location of a hidden Artifact. He smirks and thinks to himself (and unwittingly speaks aloud), “You’ll never find it in my hidden wall safe.” In addition, the mage’s speaking to thin air draws the attention of spirits, making him more susceptible to Spirit magic. He suffers a –1 dice penalty when contesting or countering such spells or the powers of spirits. He suffers –1 dot to his Resistance Attribute when resisting Spirit magic (see the spell description for the specific Attribute used).",
        {
            prefix: "Schizophrenia (severe; extreme)", text: "The mage develops schizophrenia for the duration of the Paradox, which manifests as a withdrawal from reality, violent changes in behavior, and hallucinations. This derangement is the classic sort, causing the victim to talk to walls, imagine himself to be the King of Siam, or to receive murderous instructions from pets. Roleplaying this derangement requires careful thought. The Storyteller must determine a general set of behaviors relevant to the trauma that causes the condition. Hallucinations, bizarre behavior, and disembodied voices stem from a terrible inner conflict that the individual cannot resolve."
        },
        "Establish a firm idea of what that conflict is and then rationalize what kind of behavior it causes. The mage is unpredictable and dangerous. He automatically suffers a –2 penalty on all Social rolls and may be aggressive or violent toward people who confront him with trauma such as accusations, disturbing truths, or heated arguments. The mage’s predicament attracts spirits to him so that even allies might be unsure whether his rants are hallucinatory or caused by real spirits. He suffers –2 dots to his Resistance Attribute when resisting Spirit magic or the powers of spirits (see the spell description for the specific Attribute used).",
