        { prefix: "Phobia (mild)", text: "The mage is scared of a particular type of person, place or thing, perhaps the target of her Paradox-inducing spell or some other nearby subject who she might conceivably blame for the Paradox or her troubles in general. She must move away from the object of her phobia. If she must be near it, she can tolerate being no closer than her Speed in yards. If it approaches her, she must move away at least her Speed in distance in her next action. She cannot easily target the object of her phobia with spells, close combat or ranged attacks. Such attacks suffer a –5 penalty as she shakes just looking at it. If space or circumstances don’t allow her to maintain her distance, she freezes like a deer in headlights until she finds an opening by which to escape. (Her Defense still applies if attacked and she can choose to dodge and can take cover from firearms attacks, but she can take no other actions while “frozen.”) In addition, when she is targeted by supernatural powers from the object of her fear, she suffers a –1 dice penalty on any roll to contest or counter the power. She suffers –1 dot to her Resistance Attribute when resisting magic from the object of her fear (see the spell description for the specific Attribute used)." },
        { prefix: "Hysteria (severe)", text: "This condition operates as a phobia, but the mage cannot be in the same room with the object of her fear. She must run away from it immediately, and cannot tolerate being within sensory range (sight, sound, smell) of it. Nor can she target it with sympathetic magic. If the trigger comes within sensory range, she must run away at full running Speed as soon as she can take an action. She cannot target it for an attack under any circumstance. If it touches her, she’ll freak out and run as far away as she can, thinking of nothing else until she’s left the subject far behind. If she is unable to escape, she faints and loses consciousness for the remainder of the scene. In addition, when she is targeted by supernatural powers from the object of her fear, she suffers a –2 dice penalty on any roll to contest or counter the power. She suffers –2 dots to her Resistance Attribute when resisting magic from the object of her fear (see the spell description for the specific Attribute used)." },
