        "Mages can scrutinize a person, place or thing's aura to find out more about that subject, even hidden or secret information. An aura has layers; mages must dig through the strata to get at secret truths.",
        "Mages can cast a simple spell using the first dot of any Arcanum to perceive resonance, what the Atlanteans called the Practice of Unveiling. Once the spell is active, a sorcerer can see the resonances of all objects, typically as faintly glowing auras, although some mages experience resonance differently, and some Arcana tend to color the experience. (Mind can pick up resonance as ideas and emotional impressions, Life as scents and flavors, and Forces sometimes shows resonance as sounds.)",
        "Once a resonance-sensing spell is active, a mage can examine any resonance in her area. Successes reveal clues about various aspects of a resonance under investigation. (The Storyteller should make the rolls, since the player should not know when his roll is modified by various factors such as a target's Occultation Merit; see below.) Unlike many tasks, this isn't an all-or-nothing effort. If the mage has to abandon the scrutiny before she's finished, she may still come away with some useful information depending on the number of successes rolled. The Storyteller should share information each time a roll yields a success, as per the guidelines below. Generally, he should start with the most obvious facts and reveal increasingly obscure bits as scrutiny continues. At no time should the player know how many successes are needed to complete the analysis. She should always wonder whether her character should invest a little more time and dig deeper. Storytellers may choose to make these rolls for players in secret to add uncertainty and suspense. If any perception roll is failed, use the penalties listed for 'Successive Attempts,' p. 132 of the World of Darkness Rulebook.",
