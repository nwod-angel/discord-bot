        { prefix: "Narcissism (mild)", text: "The mage is overcome with a sense of his own greatness — even if the spell that invoked the Paradox fails. For the duration of the Bedlam Paradox, he does not work and play well with others. When called upon to aid in a task, he does so only half-heartedly, unless it’s a task focused on him or his own needs or wants. He suffers a –3 penalty when participating in teamwork efforts (see p. 134 of the World of Darkness Rulebook), and he’s a self-obsessed bore whose Social rolls suffer a –1 penalty. In addition, he suffers a –1 dice penalty on Wisdom rolls to resist gaining a derangement whenever his Wisdom drops (such as if he murders someone and his Wisdom is degraded for it)." },
        { prefix: "Melancholia (severe)", text: "The effects of Narcissism apply, except that the penalties intensify by one. The mage is also highly competitive. He cannot allow himself to fail a contest (even a contested roll). If he does, he obsesses about it and works to arrange a rematch when it’s most beneficial for him. If, for example, he fails to get his car over the finish line in time while an ally succeeds, he doesn’t let it go. He constantly insists that he did the job just fine and that his successor took the glory, and demands that similar efforts be tried again, even under inappropriate circumstances such as at an office or restaurant. If the character ever loses a contest to someone he feels is socially inferior, he loses one point of Willpower due to shame and self-loathing (which is at the heart of his megalomania; he secretly fears that he’s a fraud). In addition, he suffers a –2 dice penalty on Wisdom rolls to resist gaining a derangement whenever his Wisdom drops (such as if he steals from someone and his Wisdom is degraded for it)." },
