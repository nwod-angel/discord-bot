        { prefix: "Avoidance (mild)", text: "The mage cannot face something about the current situation (it might be his enemy, his friends, or an innocent bystander) and will do everything he can to avoid it, short of harming himself or others. He might escape the scene or disguise himself as a bystander to sidle away. If he must confront (or can’t escape) the situation, any rolls made suffer a –1 penalty. He cannot target the situation, object, or person he tries to avoid with magic." },
        { prefix: "Fugue (severe; extreme)", text: "The stress of the current situation is too great for the mage, and he experiences a \"blackout\" and loss of memory. He performs a specific, rigid set of behaviors to remove the stressful symptoms. This syndrome differs from multiple personalities in that an individual in the grip of a fugue has no separate personality. Instead, he is on a form of \"autopilot\" similar to sleepwalking. The player should roleplay the mage’s trance-like state by performing a sequence of behaviors that he performs almost robotically. He might repetitively untie and tie his shoes, walk to the corner of the room and refuse to come out, or curl into the fetal position. If the Storyteller is not satisfied by the character’s reaction, he might take control of the character for the duration of the bout. The fugue lasts for the remainder of the Bedlam’s duration. At the end of the fugue, the character \"regains consciousness\" with no memory of his actions. If outsiders (including friends and enemies) interfere with or try to prevent his mechanical activities, he may attack them to carry on. He might even attempt to cast magic while in his fugue." },
