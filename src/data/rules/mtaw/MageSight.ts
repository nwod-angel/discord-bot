        "Mages have a number of means by which they can open their eyes to the supernatural, seeing (or even hearing, smelling, touching and tasting) the subtle currents of supernatural powers at work in the world. While all mages have an innate sixth sense to detect the presence of active powers (see above), it does not allow them to identify or analyze such powers. For that, they need to enchant their senses with one of the Unveiling Practices of the many Arcana. Although these spells come in many forms, they are collectively called Mage Sight.",
        "Besides revealing magic and other supernatural powers, these spells make resonance obvious to the senses. Mages can read this resonance to identify its qualities. See 'Resonance,' pp. 277-280, for rules on scrutinizing magic with these spells.",
        "Finally, some Arcana can be used to sense or analyze certain powers better than others, although all Arcana can be used to sense supernatural power. If the power is mystically concealed, however, successes rolled for the mage must equal or exceed the Potency of the magic used to conceal the source. Note that Mage Sight does not allow a sorcerer to see or interact with Twilight beings or entities. That requires other spells (usually Death and Spirit).",
