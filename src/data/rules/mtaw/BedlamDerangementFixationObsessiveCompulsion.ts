This could be the failure or success of the spell that invoked the Paradox, or an event that preceded the casting, The mage’s player rolls a single die. The result is the number of scenes (regardless of Wisdom) in which the character is focused on the offending or inspiring event or task, to the possible exclusion of more important goals. He fixates on what he believes caused him to lose or win his goal whether it’s an opponent, a broken shoelace, or the model of car driven. In the case of a defeat, he cannot help but simmer in anger, cursing a circumstance or trying to devise a method of circumventing it in the future. In the case of a victory, he becomes a fanatic, spending much of his time researching, observing, or acclaiming an activity or factor that allowed him to succeed."

        "The Storyteller rules on how this derangement affects the mage’s dice pools or behavior. It might cause him a –1 penalty on any task not related to his fixation, or he might refuse to engage in an activity if it doesn’t somehow tie into his obsession. In addition, the mage’s inability to let go interferes with his ability to envision an Imago that is not directly concerned with the object of his fixation. He suffers a –1 penalty on any spellcasting that does not involve the fixation.",
        {
            prefix: "Obsessive Compulsion (severe)", text: "The trauma, guilt, or inner conflict that causes this derangement forces the character to focus nearly all of his attention and energy on a single repetitive behavior or action. Obsession relates to an individual’s desire to control his environment — keeping clean, keeping an area quiet and peaceful, or keeping undesirable individuals out. A compulsion is an action or set of actions that an individual is driven to perform to soothe his anxieties — placing objects in an exact order, constantly checking to make sure a weapon is loaded, praying every few hours to give thanks for surviving that long."

        "Determine a set of specific actions or behaviors that the mage follows to the exclusion of all else (even if doing so interferes with his current agenda or endangers his life or others’). If your character is forcibly prevented from adhering to his derangement, he may lose control among enemies or allies and attack either (or both) indiscriminately. In addition, he suffers a –2 penalty on any spellcasting roll that does not involve the obsessive behavior.",
