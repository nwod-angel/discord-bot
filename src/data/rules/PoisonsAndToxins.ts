        "While some poisons or toxins might affect behavior and awareness as drugs do, most simply inflict lethal damage. These substances threaten a character’s very existence. Indeed, drugs can do so too when overdosed. Poisons, toxins and drug overdoses must be delivered to a victim by a required means: injection, ingestion, inhalation or touch.",
        { prefix: "Injection", text: "The substance is introduced directly into the bloodstream, by a needle or through injury such as by a sword coated with venom. At least one success is required on an attack roll to deliver the injection on a resisting target. Unless the poison is designed to damage or destroy the blood itself, vampires are probably immune." },
        { prefix: "Ingestion", text: "The poison is administered in food or drink; these substances usually take longer to activate than others (say, an hour as opposed to immediate effects). Vampires are immune to most ingested poisons." },
        { prefix: "Inhalation", text: "The poison is breathed in as a gas. Vampires are immune to most inhaled poisons." },
        { prefix: "Touch", text: " Mere skin contact is all that’s required to activate the poison. A touch is often sufficient to deliver the toxin (see p. 157), and a target’s armor may apply as a penalty to the roll." },
        "Once delivered, the poison automatically deals damage (usually lethal, but a knockout gas could cause bashing) equal to its toxicity level. Some substances inflict damage only once. Others might inflict it for a number of turns or once per hour until purged or until the effect runs its course. It could be possible to resist the effects of such substances by rolling Stamina + Resolve in a reflexive and contested action. If more successes are rolled than damage is inflicted by the toxin, damage is ignored completely. If damage is equal to higher than success rolled, all damage is delivered as normal. Such a contested roll might occur once or in each period in which a toxin causes harm.",
