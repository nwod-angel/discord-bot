        "The object of any fight is to knock the other guy out without letting him do the same to you. At the same time that your character throws punches and looks for a chance to land a knockout blow, he bobs, weaves and ducks, making himself as difficult a target as possible for his opponent’s counterblows. Your character’s Defense trait is applied as a negative modifier to his opponent’s rolls for Brawl, Weaponry and thrown-weapon (Dexterity + Athletics) attacks. If he is assaulted by multiple attackers, his full Defense trait is applied to one attacker and then his trait is reduced by one for each subsequent attack. Your character’s Defense cannot normally be used against Firearms (gun and bow-based) attacks, unless they’re conducted within close-combat range; one to two yards (see “Firearms and Close Combat,” p. 162). Defense does not apply if your character is taken by surprise or is immobilized by some means.",

            example: true, text: "Sims finds himself in a barroom brawl with three bikers. His Dexterity is 4 and his Wits is 2. Taking the lower of the two Attributes, his Defense trait is 2. As the bikers wade in Sims does his best to avoid their swings. The first biker suffers a -2 modifier to his attack roll — Sims’ full Defense — while the second biker incurs only a -1 modifier. The third attacker is unaffected, as Sims has no Defense left to avoid the assailant’s punch."

        "Defense is not affected by any wound penalties (p. 171) that your character may have incurred.  For more details on how Defense is used in combat, see Chapter 7, p. 155.",
        "As your character’s Dexterity and Wits increase through the application of experience points (or through temporary enhancement during the course of a story), his Defense may change as well. If you increase your character’s Dexterity or Wits don’t forget to adjust his Defense accordingly."
