        "Gnosis determines a character’s potential to gain mastery of an Arcanum and even master successive Arcana. It also determines his potential for archmastery. See the 'Arcana Mastery' chart.",
        "The higher a mage’s Gnosis, the harder it is for him to cloak or hide his personal or magical resonance from others. Anyone scrutinizing the mage or his spells might gain a bonus to observation rolls; see the Gnosis chart.",
        "A mage’s odds of causing a Paradox with his magic increase as his Gnosis rises. His very will is increasingly out of synch with the Fallen World as his understanding of the higher world grows. See 'Invoking a Paradox,' pp. 123-125."
