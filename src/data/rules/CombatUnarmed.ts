        "Not all fights between combatants involve knives and clubs. In fact, bringing a weapon to a fight implicitly states that the struggle is serious. One or more people will not only be hurt but possibly killed. The alternative is to go into a fight unarmed, using only one’s body as a weapon.  Unarmed combat applies the Brawl Skill and usually inflicts bashing damage. Going unarmed into battle doesn’t have to put one at a disadvantage over opponents. Training in this style of combat can make your character fully capable of disabling others.",
        "There is a variety of options possible in Brawl combat. The fundamentals available to anyone include punches, kicks, and grapples. More versatile and even exotic maneuvers — throws, nerve pinches — are learned by studying the martial arts. See the Boxing and Kung Fu Fighting Style Merits (pp. 110 and 111) for examples of such training. The average guy on the street with no martial training can perform any of the following basics.",

            text: "Your character’s teeth — whether human-sized or gigantic fangs — clamp down on a target. Roll Strength + Brawl, with a number of bonus dice based on the size of the attacker’s jaws and teeth. An ordinary human’s offer no bonus. A large dog’s offer +1. A wolf’s confer a +2 bonus. A great white shark gets a +4 bonus. Generally, a bite from a person inflicts bashing damage, while that from an animal or supernatural creature inflicts lethal harm. The Storyteller may decree that a human combatant can bite an opponent only after successfully grappling (see below)."
