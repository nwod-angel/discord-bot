        "Your characterâ€™s Speed trait indicates how many yards he can travel in a single turn by walking or jogging. He can travel that many yards and still perform an action, all in the same turn. He can move and perform an action, or perform an action and then move. He cannot, however, move, perform an action and then move again all in the same turn.",
        "If he moves more quickly, he can travel up to twice his Speed trait in a turn by running. Doing so is considered a full action and no other feats can usually be performed while running. A special Merit or supernatural power is required to accomplish such combined tasks, or your character charges (see below)."
