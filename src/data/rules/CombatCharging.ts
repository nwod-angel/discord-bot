        "Your character can charge an opponent in close combat — in a Brawl or Weaponry attack. Essentially, he closes a considerable distance with a target and is able to attack. Your character can move up to twice his Speed and stage an attack at the end of his movement, all in the same turn.",
        "Your character’s Defense score is not subtracted from any attacks made against him in the turn. He makes a relatively easy target of himself by making a beeline to a specific opponent.",
        "Your character cannot charge and make an 'All-Out Attack' (see p. 157) in the same action. Nor can he charge and perform any other special attack that requires him to give up his Defense as a drawback to the maneuver. He can perform one maneuver or the other.",
        "If your character’s Defense is applied against any incoming attacks in a turn, he cannot perform a charge in the same turn. If incoming attacks precede his position in Initiative, he has to suffer those attacks without the benefits of Defense in order to conduct a charge at his place in Initiative."
