      "Gnosis is a trait rated from 1 to 10 dots. As the measure of a mage’s magical will, Gnosis has the following game effects.",
      "Players roll Gnosis + Arcanum when casting improvised spells. Gnosis is the 'raw ability' of this formula. While a mage’s knowledge of a particular Arcanum may vary, her Supernal power remains a constant. Mages with a high Gnosis rating are more proficient and powerful improvisational spellcasters. See 'Spellcasting,' pp. 110-129, for complete details.",
      "The higher a mage’s Gnosis, the more quickly he can cast elaborate or powerful spells. See 'Extended Casting,' p. 121, for more details on how Gnosis affects the time per roll.",
      "Gnosis affects a mage’s ability to quickly muster his innate magical energy, governing how many points of Mana a player can spend in a single turn. Gnosis also limits how much Mana a mage can hold within his Pattern. The higher his Gnosis, the more Mana he can store. See the 'Effects of Gnosis' chart.",
      "Mages with Gnosis 6 or higher can increase their Attributes and Skills past 5 dots. The potential of the mage’s Pattern is increased beyond the mundane, allowing him to bolster his Mental, Physical and Social capabilities to inhuman degrees.",
      "Mages can maintain only a certain number of active spells simultaneously, equal to Gnosis + 3. The more potent their Supernal will, the more spells they can keep active. A mage cannot exceed this limit. If he has already reached it, he must cancel one of his active spells before he can cast a new spell.",
      "Mages can combine spells into a single casting. The total number a mage can combine into one casting is limited by his Gnosis. (He must also have a higher degree of Arcanum competence than normally required.) See 'Combined Spells,' pp. 128-129, for complete rules."
