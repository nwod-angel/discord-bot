        "Sometimes there’s no cover to be found when your character comes under fire, and he dives to the ground as a last resort. Or your character has been crawling to avoid being spotted, or he simply just lies on the ground. Regardless of the reason, it all boils down to going prone.",
        "Ranged attacks suffer a -2 penalty when the target is prone.",
        "A standing attacker who uses a Brawl or Weaponry attack gets a +2 dice bonus to hit a prone target in close combat. If an attacker approaches a prone target such that he is about a yard away (within range to be considered in close combat), and conducts a ranged attack at the target, the attack receives the +2 bonus. The ranged attack is also subject to the target’s Defense, though, even if it’s a Firearms attack. See “Firearms and Close Combat,” p. 162, for more details.",
        "Your character can willingly drop to prone as a reaction to ranged attacks or other events in his surroundings. Doing so constitutes his action for the turn.",
        "He may even go prone before his rotation in Initiative, if he has not yet acted in the turn.",
        "Thus, if an opponent draws a gun and starts firing on Initiative 12, your character with Initiative 8 can go prone at the same time that the shots are fired (on 12). Your character loses all other actions for the turn, however. If he goes prone before his normal stage of Initiative, your character cannot move up to his Speed. He must 'hit the dirt' where he stands. If he goes prone at his normal stage of Initiative, he may move up to his Speed and go prone in the same turn.",
        "If your character has already acted in a turn, he cannot go prone thereafter. Say he acts on Initiative 11. On Initiative 7 in the same turn, someone with a gun starts firing. Your character cannot go prone because he has already acted in the turn.",
        "Rising from prone is an action and must be performed in its own turn. Your character could therefore rise from prone and remain stationary or rise from prone and move up to his Speed in the same turn."
